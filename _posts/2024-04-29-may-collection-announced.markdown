## Summer Blockbusters

For over 4 decades, audiences and studios alike have eagerly awaited the summer months. To many, summer has become synonymous with sitting in a theater seeing some of the biggest, and most eye-popping flicks of the year. To celebrate the power of these films, we're featuring the top summer blockbuster from every year since 1975. 

The nature and appeal of the summer blockbuster has changed over time. In fact, audience's relationship to movie theaters has changed dramatically in the last decade and the slate of films featured throughout this collection, we feel highlights this dynamic relationship. 

### Jaws (1975)
*The First Summer Blockbuster*

Prior to 1970, the summer months were typically a slow time in film - why see a movie when the sun is shining? Despite this, *Jaws* was an instant hit with young audiences whose natural environment was not the beach but the shopping mall. With the number of multiplex malls increasing rapidly, *Jaws* rode the high with a new generation of moviegoers who, as film historian Thomas Schatz wrote, had "time and spending money and a penchant for wandering suburban shopping malls and for repeated viewings of favorite films".  

In the wake of *Jaws's* massive success, film-makers and studios began to see summer months as prime-time for big broad appeal movies. Not only did *Jaws* alter release calendars, but *Jaws* also established a new marketing paradigm for films. By front-loading promotion and using saturation marketing, studios could turn a movie into an **event**. The promotion budget for *Jaws* was a staggering $700,000 dollars - unheard of at the time, but a seeming bargain by today's film marketing standards.

Steven Spielberg's *Jaws* created the movie spectacle. It's a film that proved there can be a reason to go see a movie in a crowded theater. For the next 3 deacades the summer blockbuster would define the film industry. Has anything ever quite lived up to the OG here? Hard to say, but I'm sure someone could make a convincing case that no film ever has.
