## All Eyes on Me

> *"Social Media is just the market's answer to a generation that demanded to perform. So the market said 'Here. Perform everything, all the time, to everyone, for no reason'. It is performer and audience melded together. It is prison..."*
- Bo Burnham

Who are we when the camera is turned on us. Why do we idolize those who exist behind a screen. And, who are we when we're the one in control of the camera? For nearly a century, filmmakers have been interested in both how celebrity affects people and impacts lives (eg *Sunset Boulevard*, *All About Eve*, *A Star is Born*, *Network*) as well as the power of the mind and voyeourism of the person behind the camera (*Man With a Movie Camera*, *Blow Up*, *Body Double*). But we live in an age where we are both audience and star in the modern social media landscape. 

This month's collection is a look at films that probe at where the line between audience and performer are blurred and where we have to ask ourselves, why do we want to see this life on display. "All Eyes on Me" explores how we behave so that we might one day be the center of attention, how our lives are put on display for the enjoyment of others, and most importantly, how we try to take control of how our life is perceived by those watching it unfold from behind a screen.

### The Truman Show (1998)
*Peter Weir*

*The Truman Show* centers on Truman Burbank, whose life has been appropriated for
television. Unbeknownst to Truman but known to everyone else, he stars in a worldwide reality
show — an unending dramatic irony that exists entirely for him. In the midst of thousands of
hidden cameras, actors, and a massive set, his life is orchestrated by God-director figure
“Christof” for “24 hours a day, 7 days a week”. When *The Truman Show* aired in 1998 reality TV and the internet were in their infancy. 25 years later, it has proven prescient in our desires to watch the each other's lives unfold. 

While the film has been subject to dozens of interpretations ranging from "psychosis", to Plato's alegory of the cave, to a "culture of control", it seems also to be a film about media and technology; more specifically, it serves as a warning for the coming age, coined by Shoshanna Zuboff, as the age of "surveillance capitalism". In her book **The Age of Surveillance Capitalism**, Zuboff defines surveillance capitalism as
“a new economic order that claims human experience as free raw material for hidden
commercial practices of extraction, prediction, and sales”. In this new age, our life and experiences, our most intimate moments are harvested and put on display for the world for the profit of corporations. In this new age, we are Truman and the giant tech companies are Christof.

But perhaps this interpretation is too pessimistic. While deeply cynical of the world around us, *The Truman Show* finds deep empathy for Truman and reminds us that ultimately there is more joy in knowing ourself than watching and claiming to know someone else's life.

### EDtv (1999)
*Ron Howard*

A forgotten relic of late 90s pop culture, *EdTV* is a flop 1999 comedy that probably came out ten years too early (In fact, the more successful version of this, *Zach Stone is Gonna be Famous* came out in 2014). In it, a young Matthew McConaughey plays Ed, a video store clerk who agrees to have a film crew follow him around at all times to create a new reality TV show. Sound familiar?

*EdTV* came out 9 months after *The Truman Show* and it is nearly impossible to find any mention of EdTV that doesn't exist in the same breath as it's classier and more artful cousin. The film made $35 million to its mind-boggling $80 million production budget before being banished to daytime HBO and disowned by its director and main star. 

*The Truman Show* is the better movie, for sure, but *EdTV* has not received nearly the credit it deserves for its exploration of why we choose to put our life in the spotlight. By shedding the dramatic irony of the main character not knowing they are on camera, *EdTV* deals much more directly with the voyeurism that we choose.

Accidentally prescient in how reality tv would shape the tv landscape, why we become obsessed with celebrity, and how we claw to hold onto our five minutes of fame, *EdTV* is a fun exploration of why we watch what we watch - even when it's our own life.
