## All Eyes on Me

*"Social Media is just the market's answer to a generation that demanded to perform. So the market said 'Here. Perform everything, all the time, to everyone, for no reason'. It is performer and audience melded together. It is prison..."*
*Bo Burnham*

Who are we whwne the camera is turned on us. Why do we idolize those who exist behind a screen. And, who are we when we're the one in control of the camera? For decades (actually nearly a century now), filmmakers have been interested in both how celebrity affects people (eg Sunset Boulevard) as well as the power of behind the mind behind the camera (A man with a movie camera). But we live in an age where we are both audience and star in the modern social media realm. 

This month's collection is a look at films that probe at where the line between audience and performer are blurred and where we have to ask ourselves, why do we want to see this life on display. "All Eyes on Me" explores how we behave so that we might one day be the center of attention; how our lives are put on display for the enjoyment of others; and most importantly, how we try to take control of how our life is perceived by those who are watching our life unfold from behind a screen.

If there is one emotional thread that connects these movies, it's that we have decided the only way to be understood is for other people to validate our life via a screen. Whether we're behind the camera -- knowingly or not --, in front of it, or both, after each of these films, one sentiment rings true:
