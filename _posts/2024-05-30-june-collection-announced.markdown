## All Eyes on Me

> *"Social Media is just the market's answer to a generation that demanded to perform. So the market said 'Here. Perform everything, all the time, to everyone, for no reason'. It is performer and audience melded together. It is prison..."*
- Bo Burnham

Who are we when the camera is turned on us. Why do we idolize those who exist behind a screen. And, who are we when we're the one in control of the camera? For nearly a century, filmmakers have been interested in both how celebrity affects people and impacts lives (eg *Sunset Boulevard*, *All About Eve*, *A Star is Born*, *Network*) as well as the power of the mind and person behind the camera (*Man with a movie camera*, *Blow up*, *Body Double*). But we live in an age where we are both audience and star in the modern social media realm. 

This month's collection is a look at films that probe at where the line between audience and performer are blurred and where we have to ask ourselves, why do we want to see this life on display. "All Eyes on Me" explores how we behave so that we might one day be the center of attention; how our lives are put on display for the enjoyment of others; and most importantly, how we try to take control of how our life is perceived by those who are watching our life unfold from behind a screen.
